It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### Areas of Improvement

If there is more time, I would like to extend this application with below features:

1. Add some validation on add new photo screen
2. Add a confirmation before deleting a photo
